## I’m Ismam Tabriz (Shams)

I’m a **Full-Stack Engineer, Technical Founder, and Systems Thinker** building long-term, scalable platforms at the intersection of **AI, SaaS, fintech, and infrastructure**.

I don’t chase trends.  
I build systems that *outlive* them.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

- Founder of **Artixcore** — a multi-product technology company focused on AI-native platforms
- Architecting **enterprise-grade SaaS**, **AI trading systems**, and **developer platforms**
- Designing **AI engines**, **custom languages**, and **secure backend architectures**
- Turning complex ideas into **production-ready systems**, not demos

I care about **correctness, scale, security, and longevity**.  
If it can’t survive real users, real data, and real pressure—it’s not finished.
